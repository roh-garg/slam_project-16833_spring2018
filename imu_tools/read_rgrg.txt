put the folder imu_tools inside ros_ws/src

$ mv imu_tools ~/ros_ws/src/
$ cd ~/ros_ws
$ catkin_make

run filter 
$ rosrun imu_madgwik_filter imu_filter_node

Please note: Do not loop the rosbag while keeping the filter running. 
Everytime you run a rosbag, the filter needs to be started afresh. It has got to do with how the filter initializes and converges.
